Ah, I understand now. You're asking for a more detailed specification for the README of your project. Here's an example:

# Autocontext.EctoCallbacks

`Autocontext.EctoCallbacks` is an Elixir library that provides ActiveRecord-like callbacks for Ecto, Elixir's database wrapper. This allows you to specify functions to be executed before and after certain operations (`insert`, `update`, `delete`), enhancing control over these operations and maintaining a clean and expressive code base.

## Features

- `before_save`, `after_save`, `before_create`, `after_create`, `before_update`, `after_update`, `before_delete`, `after_delete` callbacks.
- Fully customizable with the ability to specify your own callback functions.
- Supports the Repo option, which allows you to use different Repo configurations.
- Works seamlessly with Ecto's changesets and other features.

## Usage

In the context module where you will use the schema, here's how you could use `Autocontext.EctoCallbacks`:

```elixir
defmodule Autocontext.Accounts do
  use Autocontext.EctoCallbacks,
    schema: User,
    changeset: &User.changeset/2,
    repo: Repo,
    before_save: [:validate_username, :hash_password],
    after_save: [:send_welcome_email, :track_user_creation]
end
```

In this example, `:validate_username` and `:hash_password` are functions that will be called before the `save` operation. The `:send_welcome_email` and `:track_user_creation` functions will be called after the `save` operation.


# Finders

Finders gives an easy way to access records, like find, find_by and all

```elixir
defmodule Autocontext.Accounts do
  use Autocontext.Finders,
    schema: User,
    repo: Repo
end
```

```elixir
Accounts.find!(1)
Accounts.find_by!(name: "mike")
Accounts.all
```

## Installation

Add `autocontext` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:autocontext, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then, update your dependencies:

```
$ mix deps.get
```
